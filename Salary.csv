ORGANIZATIONAL PROFILE: The mission of the Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics (MODA) is to work with City agencies and their data to help serve New Yorkers more equitably and effectively. This work takes three main forms: analyzing data to improve City agency operations; making Open Data more accessible to all New Yorkers; and advancing citywide data infrastructure, integration, and sharing. MODA’s work in partnership with agencies touch on a wide variety of areas including: public safety, education, emergency management, transportation, physical infrastructure, and economic development. Depending on the engagement, MODA staff may serve as analysts, strategic advisors, technical resources, or project managers.

In addition to work within an emergency-response climate, the Data Scientist will complete data analytics projects to better inform agency or interagency policies, programs, and operational practices. The ideal candidate should have prior experience prioritizing and responding to requests for data and analysis from senior leadership, scoping projects and seeing them through delivery, and communicating results from analysis verbally and in writing in a fast-paced environment.

ORGANIZATIONAL PROFILE: The mission of the Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics (MODA) is to work with City agencies and their data to help serve New Yorkers more equitably and effectively. This work takes three main forms: analyzing data to improve City agency operations; making Open Data more accessible to all New Yorkers; and advancing citywide data infrastructure, integration, and sharing. MODA’s work in partnership with agencies touch on a wide variety of areas including: public safety, education, emergency management, transportation, physical infrastructure, and economic development. Depending on the engagement, MODA staff may serve as analysts, strategic advisors, technical resources, or project managers.

MODA is also responsible for implementing the New York City Open Data Law, the most ambitious and comprehensive open data legislation in the country. MODA partners with the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT) to manage the City’s Open Data program, which has over 2,500 publicly available datasets and 30,000 weekly users, and achieve Open Data for All, the Mayor’s vision to maximize New Yorkers’ engagement with City data.

During the current COVID-19 emergency, MODA is providing critical citywide data analysis and integrations to support the City’s response. MODA plays a pivotal role in the City during emergencies, and MODA staff are serving seven days a week as data analysts, strategic advisors, technical resources, and project managers in a range of topics in partnership with City agencies including: public safety, education, emergency management, transportation, physical infrastructure, and economic development.

POSITION DESCRIPTION: MODA seeks a Data Scientist to join a diverse mission-driven urban analytics office and serve as part of the Analytics team, which practices and advances responsible and open analytics in the City of New York, and is a critical player in any Citywide emergency response. MODA data scientists balance thinking and doing: we are curious and ask questions, but also passionate about rolling up our sleeves to deliver timely answers to complex questions. The successful candidate should be a relentless problem solver, constantly curious and “question asker,” driven to find insights and “a-ha” moments in data and information, and to deliver recommendations to improve operations. Examples of prior analytics projects are on the MODA project library (https://moda-nyc.github.io/Project-Library/projects/) and more about the team is available on the MODA team page (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/analytics/about/meet-team.page).

MODA serves an essential data analysis and critical coordination role to support the City’s COVID-19 response, and the Data Scientist’s projects will include delivering insights to City agency leadership on prioritizing and allocating operational resources, detecting anomalies for policy reviews, and forecasting and projecting demand and supply chain. Examples of recent COVID-19 data analytic projects include:

In addition to work within an emergency-response climate, the Data Scientist will complete data analytics projects to better inform agency or interagency policies, programs, and operational practices. The ideal candidate should have prior experience prioritizing and responding to requests for data and analysis from senior leadership, scoping projects and seeing them through delivery, and communicating results from analysis verbally and in writing in a fast-paced environment. The Data Scientist will report to the MODA Assistant Director for Data Analytics, and work closely with other members of the Analytics Team and MODA office on projects. An interest and/or understanding of New York City policy and operations or strong policy or operational analysis capabilities is preferred but not required.
